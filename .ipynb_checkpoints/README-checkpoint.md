# JetBrains ML Engineer Intern (CLPD) Test  Assignment

__Task Description:__
Please, send us a link to a git repository with the self-contained, reproducible Jupyter notebook that includes code and text comparing any two existing open source solutions for the problem described in the position posting (e.g enry and pygments) on some small but realistic dataset of your choice (e.g clone several OSS git repositories). It must be possible to re-run all the cells in the notebook without any errors to get similar results. Be prepared to discuss the implementation details and trade-offs of each of the chosen approaches.
