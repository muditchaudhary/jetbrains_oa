    "Please, send us a link to a git repository with the self-contained, reproducible Jupyter notebook that includes code and text comparing any two existing open source solutions for the problem described in the position posting (e.g enry and pygments) on some small but realistic dataset of your choice (e.g clone several OSS git repositories). It must be possible to re-run all the cells in the notebook without any errors to get similar results. Be prepared to discuss the implementation details and trade-offs of each of the chosen approaches.  \n",

    "## 1. Chosen Open source solutions programming language detection task\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, I choose the following open source solutions for the programming language detection task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Enry:__ Programming language detector and toolbox to ignore binary or vendored files. enry, started as a port to Go of the original Linguist Ruby library, that has an improved 2x performance. [Link](https://github.com/go-enry/go-enry)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __GuessLang:__ Guesslang is neural network based programming language detector which supports over 50 programming languages. It is also used by Microsoft VS Code for programming languages detection. [Link](https://guesslang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Motivation to choose these solutions\n",
    "These two solutions are chosen because of their inherent differences in how they approach the problem. Enry focuses on a multi-faceted approach by utilizing not only the file content but also other features such as file name, extensions, etc., whereas, Guesslang only focuses on the file content. We will discuss about the differences between their implementations as we go through this notebook."
